#TwoSun
Solution generated by copilot, clever enough to keep. It loops through the collection of numbers. For each number it checks to see if the target - current number has been seen. If so, it returns the current number and current  number.

The first solution I used was brute force which was more stright forword. Iterating thru the array and and for each element run an inner loop to check for solution.
